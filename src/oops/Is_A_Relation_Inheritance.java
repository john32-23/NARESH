	// Relationship between the classes is going to established in JAVA
	// in two ways below
	// 1. Is- A relation we can achieve by Inheritance Concept 
	// 2. 2. Has- A Relation we can achieve by Association Concept. Association further divided
	// into AGGREGATION AND COMPOSITION means Strong and WEAK Reference
	
	
	// WORA means write once run anywhere means we wrote program in ONE OPERATING system, But because
	// of Java platform Independence, we can run this program in any platform like LINUX, MAC.
	
	// The term Inheritance we used for Code reusebility, means how we reuse our code again and again.
    // for example below two DEVELOPERS
	
	/*
	 * Developer1 class{
	 * 
	 * public void sum(int a , int b) {
	 * 
	 *  // a+b 
	 *  }
	 *  
	 *  public void subtraction(int a , int b) {
	 *  
	 *  // a-b;
	 *  }
	 *  
	 * }
	 * 
	 *  //  now Developer 1 close this class or Save in current project
	 *  , But suppose after 2 or 3 months the company Hired new Developer and the task
	 *  for this New Developer2 is two do a job to do multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction
	 *  So He will create a new in this project, see below
	 *  
	 *  Class Developer2 {
	 *  
	 *  public void sum(int a , int b) {
	 *  
	 *   // a+b 
	 *   
	 *   }
	 *   
	 *   public void subtraction(int a, int b) {
	 *   
	 *    //a-b;
	 *    }
	 *    
	 *    public void multiplication(int a, int b) {
	 *    
	 *    a*b
	 *    
	 *    }
	 *    
	 *    public void division(int a, int b) {
	 *    
	 *      // a/b
	 *    }
	 *    
	 *    }
	 *    
	 *    Now you see the same code has been done by the DEVELOPER1 like ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION
	 *    it is called code redunduncy or duplication like using same code in two classes, it is called the worst type of programming
	 *    You will always make sure that there is an Application Everyone has to do their job and somebody already done their job.
	 *    Always N must sure to REUSE the code if someOne ALREADY created some part of the Application rather than creating a new One.
	 *    
	 *    
	 *  Means ReUSING not Recreating. for Reusing we USE the KEYWORD in JAVA for Inheritance Concept called  extends
	 *  "EXTENDs" KEYWORD all lower case, So Developer2 needs to Reuse Or extend the Properties (Variables) and methods (Behavoirs) like
	 *  addition and subtraction and then Developr2 Start or create code for SUBTRACTION and Division.
	 *  
	 *  SO Developr1 wiLL BE REFER to a PARENT/Base/Super class and DEVELOPER2 class will be REFER to CHILD/DERIVED/SUBCLASS class
	 *  
	 *
